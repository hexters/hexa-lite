Filament Hexa Lite is an effortless role & permission plugin for Filament, inspired by the concept of [hexters/ladmin](https://github.com/hexters/ladmin). This concept facilitates managing each role and permission inline with code and provides an easy-to-understand interface.

This plugin is intended only for Administrators, as it has a separate admin table from the user table provided by Laravel. Additionally, this plugin will replace the `auth.php` configuration file.

## About Filament

[FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com/) is a lightweight and flexible PHP framework designed for building web applications. It aims to simplify application development by providing a clear structure and high modularity. The framework emphasizes speed, efficiency, and comes with many built-in features that facilitate effective web application development.

## Installation

> **Note** <br>
You need to install the filament package first. You can refer to the official site at [FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com)

You can install it by running the command below:

```bash
composer require hexters/hexa-lite:1.3
```

Then, proceed with the installation of the hexa plugin:
```bash
php artisan hexa:install
```

Install database migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Create a superadmin account for admin login:
```bash
php artisan hexa:account --create
```

## Plugin Setup

Add the Filament `HexaLite` plugin to the created panel. If you haven't created one yet, see how to do it here [Creating a new panel](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/configuration#creating-a-new-panel).

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Hexters\HexaLite\HexaLite;
 
public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            HexaLite::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Declaring Access Permissions

### Resource & Page

To declare access permissions for Resources and Pages, for Clusters you need to upgrade to the [hexters/hexa](https://github.com/hexters/hexa-docs) package.

```php
use Hexters\HexaLite\Traits\HexAccess;

. . .

use HexAccess;

protected static ?string $permissionId = 'access.user';

protected static ?string $descriptionPermission = 'Admin can manage User accounts';

/**
 * Additional permission (optional)
 * You can add it or not depending on the needs of your application.
 */
protected static ?array $subPermissions = [
    'access.user.create' => 'Can Create',
    'access.user.edit' => 'Can Edit',
    'access.user.delete' => 'Can Delete',
];

public static function canAccess(): bool
{
    return hexa()->can(static::$permissionId);
}

. . .
```

### Actions, etc.

You can use the `visible()` method on several `Class Components`. For example, let's try it on a button.

```php
Tables\Actions\EditAction::make()
    ->visible(hexa()->can('access.user.edit')),
```

For giving access to classes extended to `Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord`, `Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord`, `Filament\Resources\Pages\ListRecords`, `Filament\Resources\Pages\ViewRecords`, you can use:
```php
/**
 * @param  array<string, mixed>  $parameters
 */
public static function canAccess(array $parameters = []): bool
{
    return hexa()->can('access.user.edit');
}
```

## Checking Access Permissions

Access can be granted to Resources, Pages, Widgets, Button Actions, etc. The access can be given as shown below.

Using the hexa utility function:
```php
hexa()->can('hexa.admin')
```

Using Laravel's auth can function:
```php
auth()->user()?->can('hexa.admin')
```

Using Laravel's Gate class:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;

. . .

Gate::allows('hexa.admin')
```

In a blade template, you can use it as shown below.

```html
<div>
    @can('hexa.admin')
        // Content here ...
    @endcan
</div>
```
